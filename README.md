### PROJECT: Pricing Table

---

**Kevin says**:

> _For this project, weâ€™re building out a pricing table, which you can see below. There isnâ€™t anything too fancy going on, but it raises a few interesting topics when it comes to naming conventions, as well as allowing us to go over everything weâ€™ve learned so far._

**The mage of the pricing table we are building**:

**While at it I also did**:

- [x] some markdown revision (it resulted in this md file)
- [x] I had to brush up my git and github notes (using git commands, VSC extension GitLens, Oh-my-zsh git plugin aliases, gh cli)
- [x] I also "unscrambled" the use of npm scripts

> _Everything is kept in my notes in Notes_ ğŸ˜‰
